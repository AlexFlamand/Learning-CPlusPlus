## Information 
Programs developed in the Spring of 2018 for Engineering 102 at Shepherd University. Here you will find my original C++ source code that I wrote during that time in their final form. All of these were written in Microsoft Visual Studio and debugged through its local debugging console. My only intention for this repository is purely for archival purposes and general posterity. I would very much like to know if you are able to find a useful purpose for these programs; however, please note that they were not designed with user-friendliness in mind, and at the time of this writing have no intention of developing these into full-fledged applications. Not all of these programs are garunteed to function properly or at all, and some are missing key documentation, so please keep this in mind when attempting to adapt or use this source code.

Adapted and based around examples provided in the book *C++ for Engineers and Scientists (4th Edition)* by Gary J. Bronson.
